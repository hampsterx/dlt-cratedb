# CrateDB destination adapter backlog

## Iteration +1

- Check if the Redshift literal escaper is the right choice for all
  data types it is handling. It leaves newlines inside strings unescaped,
  while dlt's `insert_values` loader splits a load file into statements
  line by line. A load file larger than `max_query_length // 2` (2 MiB)
  that carries multi-line strings is cut in the middle of a string and
  fails with `SyntaxError: ... no viable alternative at input 'VALUES ...`.
  The `players_games` resource of the `chess` source runs into this.
  CrateDB accepts `E'...'` escape strings, e.g. `SELECT E'a\nb'`.

- `dlt init chess cratedb` fails, because the dlt CLI does not import
  `dlt_cratedb`, so it cannot resolve the `cratedb` destination.

- ERROR: mismatched input 'ABORT' expecting {....

- Documentation: How JSONB/ARRAYs are mapped to CrateDB

- The `merge` followup job is currently defunct with CrateDB.
  It has been replaced by a `replace` job, so a `merge` load drops all
  rows that are not part of the batch: loading `{1, 2}` and then `{2, 3}`
  leaves `{2, 3}`. See GH-6.

- Is it possible to use an `adapter` to better support CrateDB's special
  data types? For example, full round-tripping using `sys.summits` isn't
  possible just yet, due to the `coordinates` column, for example when
  selecting DuckDB.

- Is it possible to provide other direct loaders from the `sqlalchemy`
  adapter?

- Addressing per `cratedb://` will raise errors. dlt passes the URL
  scheme through to psycopg2, which rejects it:
  `invalid dsn: invalid connection option "cratedb://crate:@localhost:5432?connect_timeout"`.
  Without a password, e.g. `cratedb://crate@localhost:5432/`, resolving
  the configuration fails even earlier:
  `Missing 1 field(s) in configuration CrateDbClientConfiguration: credentials`.
  The same happens with `postgres://crate@localhost:5432/`, so CrateDB's
  password-less default user must be spelled `crate:@`.

- Add staging support
  > CrateDB supports Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob
  > Storage as file staging destinations.

## Verify

- > Data is loaded into CrateDB using the most efficient method
  > depending on the data source.

## Iteration +2

- The `UNIQUE` constraint is dearly missing. Is it possible to emulate?
  Otherwise, when loading data multiple times, duplicates will happen.

- Provide Ibis dataset access, see
  tests/load/test_read_interfaces.py

- Software tests about geospatial concerns have been removed.
  See `postgres` adapter for bringing them back.
